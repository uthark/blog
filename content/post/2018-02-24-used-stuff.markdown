# Shell/Terminal Applications

* [zsh](http://zsh.sourceforge.net/) — ZSH is a shell. It is very good alternative to [bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) which is used by default in most Linux distributions and in macOS. macOS uses very old version of bash because bash changed it's license and Apple doesn't like GPL.
* [oh-my-zsh](http://ohmyz.sh/) — framework for easy customization of ZSH. Has a lot of additional plugins. Try not to overuse it, otherwise new ZSH session may start several seconds on a modern hardware.
* [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) — A command-line fuzzy finder. I bind it to `Cmd+R` to do search in history.
* [autoenv](https://github.com/kennethreitz/autoenv) — Directory-based environments.
* [autojump](https://github.com/wting/autojump) — A cd command that learns - easily navigate directories from the command line 
* [brew](https://brew.sh/) — Package Manager for macOS. Must have application for mac. 

# Desktop Applications

Nowdays I use macbook, so most applications listed here are macOS specific.

## Generic apps
* [iterm](https://www.iterm2.com/) — Very good replacement of macOS Terminal.app. 
* [Ilya Birman's Typography Layout](http://ilyabirman.ru/projects/typography-layout/) — this layout provides improvements over standard layout to allow easy input of specific symbols.
* [alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) - replacement for Spotlight. 
* [dash](https://kapeli.com/dash) - Documentation browser. 
* [f.lux](https://justgetflux.com/)
* [karabiner](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/) — A powerful and stable keyboard customizer for OS X.

## Productivity

* [Evernote](https://evernote.com/) — I used it for storing various information, articles from the web, notes and so on. UI is not very friendly, but it works across web, mobile and desktop, synchronisation works most of the time.
* [Evernote Skitch](https://evernote.com/skitch/) - This application is retired, but still useful. 
* [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/) - Cloud synchronisation.
* [OmniFocus](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus) — Awesome task manager application for macOS and iOS. 
* [OmniOutliner](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnioutliner) - outline software. I use it for tracking various lists, then move to archive in Evernote.
* [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/) - Read it later service.
* [1Password](https://1password.com/) - Password Manager.
* [Fantastical](https://flexibits.com/fantastical) - Calendar application.
* [ifttt](https://ifttt.com/) - Internet automation across different applications and services. 
* [Focus.app](https://heyfocus.com/) - Blocks web sites and specific apps. When you need to focus and don't want any distractions.
* [Bartender](https://www.macbartender.com/) — This small application clean top toolbar icons. You can hide those you don't need.
* [ia Writer](https://ia.net/writer/) — Distraction-free text editor
* [MindNode](https://mindnode.com) - Mind mapping software.
* [Magnet](https://...) - application which improves behaviour of standard window manager on macOS. With this app you can easily snap windows, split them and so on. Small and useful utility.


## Text Editors / IDEs

* [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) - this my work horse. Most of my code is written in this app.
* [Atom](https://atom.io/) - this is my text-editor to go. When I don't need full blown IDE, I use atom.
 
## Monospace Fonts
* [go mono](https://fontlibrary.org/en/font/go-mono) - Monospace font I use in terminal, text editors and on my site.
### Other good monospace fonts
* [source code pro](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-code-pro)
