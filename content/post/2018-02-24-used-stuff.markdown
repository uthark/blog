## Introduction
This is a dump of different things and apps I use on a daily basis.
Hope you will find it useful.

## Shell/Terminal Applications
* [zsh](http://zsh.sourceforge.net/) — ZSH is a shell. It is very good alternative to [bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) which is used by default in most Linux distributions and in macOS. macOS uses very old version of bash because bash changed it's license and Apple doesn't like GPL.
* [oh-my-zsh](http://ohmyz.sh/) — framework for easy customization of ZSH. Has a lot of additional plugins. Try not to overuse it, otherwise new ZSH session may start several seconds even on a modern hardware.
* [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) — A command-line fuzzy finder. I bind it to `Cmd+R` to do search in history.
* [autoenv](https://github.com/kennethreitz/autoenv) — Directory-based environments.
* [autojump](https://github.com/wting/autojump) — A cd command that learns - easily navigate directories from the command line
* [brew](https://brew.sh/) — Package Manager for macOS. Must have application for mac. Allows to easily install applications via CLI. Also `Brewfile` is a lifesaver.

## Desktop Applications

Nowadays I use Apple MacBook Pro primarily, so most applications listed here are macOS specific.

### Generic apps
* [iterm](https://www.iterm2.com/) — Very good replacement of macOS Terminal.app.
* [Ilya Birman's Typography Layout](http://ilyabirman.ru/projects/typography-layout/) — this layout provides improvements over standard layout to allow easy input of specific symbols.
* [alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) - replacement for Spotlight.

### Productivity

* [Evernote](https://evernote.com/) — I used it for storing various information, articles from the web, notes and so on. UI is not very friendly, but it works across web, mobile and desktop, synchronisation works most of the time.
* [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/) - Cloud synchronisation.
* [OmniFocus](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus) — Awesome task manager application for macOS and iOS.
* [OmniOutliner](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnioutliner) - outline software. I use it for tracking various lists, then move to archive in Evernote.
* [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/) - Read it later service.
* [1Password](https://1password.com/) - Password Manager.
* [ifttt](https://ifttt.com/) - Internet automation across different applications and services.
* [Focus.app](https://heyfocus.com/) - Blocks web sites and specific apps. When you need to focus and don't want any distractions.
* [Bartender](https://www.macbartender.com/) — This small application clean top toolbar icons. You can hide those you don't need.
* [ia Writer](https://ia.net/writer/) — Distraction-free text editor
* [MindNode](https://mindnode.com) - Mind mapping software.
* [Magnet](http://magnet.crowdcafe.com/) - application which improves behaviour of standard window manager on macOS. With this app you can easily snap windows, split them and so on. Small and useful utility.


### Text Editors / IDEs

* [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) - this my work horse. Most of my code is written in this app.
* [vim](https://www.vim.org) - exists on most servers and linuxes.
* [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com) – use it for some temporary notes/drafts

### Monospace Fonts
* [go mono](https://fontlibrary.org/en/font/go-mono) - Monospace font I use in terminal and text editors/IDEs.

#### Other good monospace fonts
* [source code pro](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-code-pro)
* [anonymous pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Anonymous+Pro)

#### Reading
Unfortunately, have books bought via different books stores, so use different devices and applications.

* Amazon Kindle
* Apple Books
* Google Play Books
* Pocket

#### Productivity
* Evernote
* Dropbox
* Omnifocus 3
* Fantastical 2
* Google Play Music - Music subscription service.
* PocketCasts
* Launch
* SWORKIT Pro
* Dark Sky - Weather application.
* OmniOutliner - Outline Software.
* Feedly - RSS Reader.
* MindNode - iOS version of the application.
* Wunderlist - The only reason for a second task list is that it allows to share list between people. I share one list with my spouse for tracking groceries we need to buy.

### Games
Although, I don't play games heavily, I have few games installed that I would recommend:

* Monument Valley and Monument Valley 2.
* Lumino City
* Shadowmatic
* Machinarium
* Thomas was alone
* Lode Runner
* Limbo

## Physical stuff

In addition to digital things, I continue to use physical things too. We are not completely in Matrix yet.

* Backpack North Face Microbyte — my daily backpack. It is small, it holds laptop and a few other things. Probably, I need to make another blog post about the things I have in my backpack. Earlier I used North Face Router a lot, but it is quite bulky. I use it now if we go with my family outside or if I have a work trip.
* Water Bottle - clean kanteen
* External USB Charger - anker e4
* Headphones
I have several pairs for different use cases:
    * Noise cancelling: Bose QC25/QC35
    * Music listening: AKG Q701
    * Outdoor/to-go: Apple Earpods

* Kindle Paperwhite
* For jotting on paper: Moleskine and Pilot precise V5 RT
