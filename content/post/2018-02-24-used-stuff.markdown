## Introduction
This is a dump of different things and apps I use daily.
I hope you will find it helpful.

## Shell/Terminal Applications
* [zsh](http://zsh.sourceforge.net/) — ZSH is a shell. It is an excellent alternative to [bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) used by default in most Linux distributions and macOS. macOS uses the outdated version of bash because it changed its license, and Apple doesn't like GPL.
* [oh-my-zsh](http://ohmyz.sh/) — framework for easy customization of ZSH. Has a lot of additional plugins. Try not to overuse it; otherwise, a new ZSH session may start several seconds, even on modern hardware.
* [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) — A command-line fuzzy finder. I bind it to `Cmd+R` to search history.
* [autoenv](https://github.com/kennethreitz/autoenv) — Directory-based environments.
* [autojump](https://github.com/wting/autojump) — A cd command that learns - easily navigate directories from the command line
* [brew](https://brew.sh/) — Package Manager for macOS. Must have application for mac. Allows installing applications via CLI easily. Also, `Brewfile` is a lifesaver.

## Desktop Applications

Nowadays, I use Apple MacBook Pro primarily, so most applications listed here are macOS specific.

### Generic apps
* [iterm](https://www.iterm2.com/) — Very good replacement of macOS Terminal.app.
* [Ilya Birman's Typography Layout](http://ilyabirman.ru/projects/typography-layout/) — this layout improves the standard layout easy input of specific symbols.
* [alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) - replacement for Spotlight.

### Productivity

* [Evernote](https://evernote.com/) — I used it to store various information, articles from the web, notes, etc. UI is not very friendly, but it works across web, mobile, and desktop; synchronization works most of the time.
* [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/) - Cloud synchronisation.
* [OmniFocus](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus) — Awesome task manager application for macOS and iOS.
* [OmniOutliner](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnioutliner) - outline software. I use it for tracking various lists, then move to archive in Evernote.
* [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/) - Read it later service.
* [1Password](https://1password.com/) - Password Manager.
* [ifttt](https://ifttt.com/) - Internet automation across different applications and services.
* [Focus.app](https://heyfocus.com/) - Blocks websites and specific apps. When you need to focus and don't want any distractions.
* [Bartender](https://www.macbartender.com/) — This small application hides top toolbar icons. You can hide those you don't need.
* [ia Writer](https://ia.net/writer/) — Distraction-free text editor
* [MindNode](https://mindnode.com) - Mind mapping software.
* [Magnet](http://magnet.crowdcafe.com/) - an application that improves standard window manager behavior on macOS. With this app, you can easily snap windows, split them, etc. Small and helpful utility.


### Text Editors / IDEs

* [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) - this my workhorse. Most of my code is written in this app.
* [vim](https://www.vim.org) - exists on most servers and Linux.
* [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com) – use it for some temporary notes/drafts

### Monospace Fonts
* [go mono](https://fontlibrary.org/en/font/go-mono) - Monospace font I use in terminal and text editors/IDEs.

#### Other good monospace fonts
* [source code pro](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-code-pro)
* [anonymous pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Anonymous+Pro)

#### Reading
Unfortunately, I have books bought via different digital book stores, so I use multiple devices and applications.

* Amazon Kindle
* Apple Books
* Google Play Books
* Pocket

### Games
Although I don't play games heavily, I have a few games installed that I would recommend:

* Monument Valley and Monument Valley 2.
* Lumino City
* Shadowmatic
* Machinarium
* Thomas was alone
* Lode Runner
* Limbo

## Physical stuff

In addition to digital things, I continue to use material things too. We are not entirely in Matrix yet.

* Backpack North Face Microbyte — my daily backpack. It is small; it holds a laptop and a few other things. Probably, I need to make another blog post about the things I have in my backpack. Earlier I used North Face Router, but it is pretty bulky. I use it now if we go with my family outside or if I have a work trip.
* Water Bottle - clean kanteen
* External USB Charger - Anker e4
* Headphones
I have several pairs for different use cases:
    * Pair of noise-canceling headphones: Bose QC25/QC35
    * Music listening: AKG Q701
    * Outdoor/to-go: Apple Earpods

* Kindle Paperwhite
* For jotting on paper: Moleskine and Pilot precise V5 RT
